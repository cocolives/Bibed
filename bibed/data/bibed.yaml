  missing_and_omissible_data:
    content: "The fields marked as \u2018required\u2019 are not strictly required\
      \ in all cases. The bibliography styles which come with this package\
      \ can get by with as little as a <span face=\"monospace\">title</span>\
      \ field for most entry types. A book published anonymously, a periodical\
      \ without an explicit editor, or a software manual without an explicit\
      \ author should pose no problem as far as the bibliography is concerned.\
      \ Citation styles, however, may 32have different requirements. For example,\
      \ an author-year citation scheme obviously requires an <span face=\"\
      monospace\">author</span>/<span face=\"monospace\">editor</span> and\
      \ a <span face=\"monospace\">year</span> field. \n\nYou may generally\
      \ use the <span face=\"monospace\">label</span> field to provide a substitute\
      \ for any missing data required for citations. How the <span face=\"\
      monospace\">label</span> field is employed depends on the citation style.\
      \ The author-year citation styles which come with this package use the\
      \ <span face=\"monospace\">label</span> field as a fallback if either\
      \ the <span face=\"monospace\">author</span>/<span face=\"monospace\"\
      >editor</span> or the <span face=\"monospace\">year</span> is missing.\
      \ The numeric styles, on the other hand, do not use it at all since\
      \ the numeric scheme is independent of the available data. The author-title\
      \ styles ignore it as well, because the bare <span face=\"monospace\"\
      >title</span> is usually sufficient to form a unique citation and a\
      \ title is expected to be available in any case. The <span face=\"monospace\"\
      >label</span> field may also be used to override the non-numeric portion\
      \ of the automatically generated <span face=\"monospace\">labelalpha</span>\
      \ field used by alphabetic citation styles.  \n\nNote that traditional\
      \ BibTeX styles support a <span face=\"monospace\">key</span> field\
      \ which is used for alphabetizing if both <span face=\"monospace\">author</span>\
      \ and <span face=\"monospace\">editor</span> are missing. The biblatex\
      \ package treats <span face=\"monospace\">key</span> as an alias for\
      \ <span face=\"monospace\">sortkey</span>. In addition to that, it offers\
      \ very fine-grained sorting controls. Use the <span face=\"monospace\"\
      >label</span> field as a fallback label for citations."

    article: An article in a journal, magazine, newspaper, or other periodical
      which forms a self-contained unit with its own title. The title of the
      periodical is given in the <span face="monospace">journaltitle</span>
      field. If the issue has its own title in addition to the main title
      of the periodical, it goes in the <span face="monospace">issuetitle</span>
      field. Note that <span face="monospace">editor</span> and related fields
      refer to the journal while <span face="monospace">translator</span>
      and related fields refer to the article.
    book: A single-volume book with one or more authors where the authors
      share credit for the work as a whole. This entry type also covers the
      function of the <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span>
      type of traditional BibTeX.
    booklet: A book-like work without a formal publisher or sponsoring institution.
      Use the field <span face="monospace">howpublished</span> to supply publishing
      information in free format, if applicable. The field <span face="monospace">type</span>
      may be useful as well.
    inbook: Use the <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span> entry
      type for a self-contained part of a book with its own title only. It
      relates to <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@book</span> just like
      <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@incollection</span> relates to
      <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@collection</span>. If you want
      to refer to a chapter or section of a book, simply use the book type
      and add a chapter and/or pages field. Whether a bibliography should
      at all include references to chapters or sections is controversial because
      a chapter is not a bibliographic entity.
    misc: A fallback type for entries which do not fit into any other category.
      Use the field <span face="monospace">howpublished</span> to supply publishing
      information in free format, if applicable. The field type may be useful
      as well. <span face="monospace">author</span>, <span face="monospace">editor</span>,
      and <span face="monospace">year</span> are omissible in terms of @@@cite{defaults.fields.doc.missing_and_omissible_data}.
    movie: Motion pictures. See also <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@video</span>.
    mvbook: A multi-volume <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@book</span>.
      For backwards compatibility, multi-volume books are also supported by
      the entry type <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@book</span>. However,
      it is advisable to make use of the dedicated entry type <span weight="bold"
      face="monospace">@mvbook</span>.
    online: An online resource. <span face="monospace">author</span>, <span
      face="monospace">editor</span>, and <span face="monospace">year</span>
      are omissible in terms of @@@cite{defaults.fields.doc.missing_and_omissible_data}.
      This entry type is intended for sources such as web sites which are
      intrinsically online resources. Note that all entry types support the
      <span face="monospace">url</span> field. For example, when adding an
      article from an online journal, it may be preferable to use the <span
      weight="bold" face="monospace">@article</span> type and its <span face="monospace">url</span>
      field.
    report: A technical report, research report, or white paper published
      by a university or some other institution. Use the <span face="monospace">type</span>
      field to specify the type of report. The sponsoring institution goes
      in the <span face="monospace">institution</span> field.
    suppbook: Supplemental material in a <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@book</span>.
      This type is closely related to the <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span>
      entry type. While <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span>
      is primarily intended for a part of a book with its own title (e. g.,
      a single essay in a collection of essays by the same author), this type
      is provided for elements such as prefaces, introductions, forewords,
      afterwords, etc. which often have a generic title only. Style guides
      may require such items to be formatted differently from other <span
      weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span> items. The standard styles
      will treat this entry type as an alias for <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span>.
    thesis: A thesis written for an educational institution to satisfy the
      requirements for a degree. Use the <span face="monospace">type</span>
      field to specify the type of thesis.
    unpublished: A work with an author and a title which has not been formally
      published, such as a manuscript or the script of a talk. Use the fields
      <span face="monospace">howpublished</span> and <span face="monospace">note</span>
      to supply additional information in free format, if applicable.
