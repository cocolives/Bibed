    doc: An article in a journal, magazine, newspaper, or other periodical which forms
      a self-contained unit with its own title. The title of the periodical is given
      in the <span face="monospace">journaltitle</span> field. If the issue has its
      own title in addition to the main title of the periodical, it goes in the <span
      face="monospace">issuetitle</span> field. Note that <span face="monospace">editor</span>
      and related fields refer to the journal while <span face="monospace">translator</span>
      and related fields refer to the article.

    missing_and_omissible_data:
      content: "The fields marked as \u2018required\u2019 are not strictly required\
        \ in all cases. The bibliography styles which come with this package can get\
        \ by with as little as a <span face=\"monospace\">title</span> field for most\
        \ entry types. A book published anonymously, a periodical without an explicit\
        \ editor, or a software manual without an explicit author should pose no problem\
        \ as far as the bibliography is concerned. Citation styles, however, may 32have\
        \ different requirements. For example, an author-year citation scheme obviously\
        \ requires an <span face=\"monospace\">author</span>/<span face=\"monospace\"\
        >editor</span> and a <span face=\"monospace\">year</span> field. \n\nYou may\
        \ generally use the <span face=\"monospace\">label</span> field to provide\
        \ a substitute for any missing data required for citations. How the <span\
        \ face=\"monospace\">label</span> field is employed depends on the citation\
        \ style. The author-year citation styles which come with this package use\
        \ the <span face=\"monospace\">label</span> field as a fallback if either\
        \ the <span face=\"monospace\">author</span>/<span face=\"monospace\">editor</span>\
        \ or the <span face=\"monospace\">year</span> is missing. The numeric styles,\
        \ on the other hand, do not use it at all since the numeric scheme is independent\
        \ of the available data. The author-title styles ignore it as well, because\
        \ the bare <span face=\"monospace\">title</span> is usually sufficient to\
        \ form a unique citation and a title is expected to be available in any case.\
        \ The <span face=\"monospace\">label</span> field may also be used to override\
        \ the non-numeric portion of the automatically generated <span face=\"monospace\"\
        >labelalpha</span> field used by alphabetic citation styles.  \n\nNote that\
        \ traditional BibTeX styles support a <span face=\"monospace\">key</span>\
        \ field which is used for alphabetizing if both <span face=\"monospace\">author</span>\
        \ and <span face=\"monospace\">editor</span> are missing. The biblatex package\
        \ treats <span face=\"monospace\">key</span> as an alias for <span face=\"\
        monospace\">sortkey</span>. In addition to that, it offers very fine-grained\
        \ sorting controls. Use the <span face=\"monospace\">label</span> field as\
        \ a fallback label for citations."

      a self-contained part of a book with its own title only. It relates to <span

      relates to <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@collection</span>. If you want
      to refer to a chapter or section of a book, simply use the book type and add
      a chapter and/or pages field. Whether a bibliography should at all include references
      to chapters or sections is controversial because a chapter is not a bibliographic
      entity.

      This type is closely related to the <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span>
      entry type. While <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span> is primarily
      intended for a part of a book with its own title (e. g., a single essay in a
      collection of essays by the same author), this type is provided for elements
      such as prefaces, introductions, forewords, afterwords, etc. which often have
      a generic title only. Style guides may require such items to be formatted differently
      from other <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span> items. The standard
      styles will treat this entry type as an alias for <span weight="bold" face="monospace">@inbook</span>.
